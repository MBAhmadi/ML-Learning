## Introduction

This project is part of my journey to learn machine learning. The goal is to [specific goal, e.g., build a model to predict house prices, classify images, etc.], while applying and understanding various ML concepts and techniques.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the basics of machine learning.
- Learn how to preprocess data.
- Gain experience in training and evaluating machine learning models.
- Explore different machine learning algorithms.
- Learn how to use popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
